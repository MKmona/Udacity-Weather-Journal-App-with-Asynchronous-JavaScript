## Instructions

- Run the project by writing the following command line in the terminal:
    node server.js
- You may need to install the three packages that I used, which are (express, body-parser, and cors). From the terminal write the following command line:
    npm install Package-name
- Open the index.html in a web browser. In the browser write localhost:3000. That's my port number.
- In the browser, you should enter a valid zipcode for a city and your feeling. Then click on the button named "Generate".
